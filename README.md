# JCloud Website

This was the source for the [jcloud website](http://jcloud.com.au), originally built using the [jcframe framework](https://github.com/digitalspider/jcframe). but later enhanced to use the jcloud framework.

This is now deprecated and has been moved into the [jcloud](https://github.com/digitalspider/jcloud) repository.
